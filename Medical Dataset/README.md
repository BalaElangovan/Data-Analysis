## Data Analysis on Medical Dataset:

1. About the Dataset: This dataset contains information about individual patients, including their age, sex, body mass index (BMI), number of children, smoking status, and region.


2. Goal: The goal is to use this information to predict the amount of money a patient will spend on hospital charges"


3. Steps involved:

    (I) I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of the data and identify any patterns or trends.

    (ii) Next, I will preprocess the data to prepare it for modeling.

    (iii) I will then use linear regression to build a model to predict hospital charges.

    (iv) Finally, I will evaluate the performance of the model and visualize the results.

4. Techniques: I will use various techniques such as visualizations, statistical analysis and data preprocessing to uncover insights and build a robust model.
